# Braaaiiiins: An FSM-Driven Zombie Survival Game

Welcome to Braaaiiiins! This is a zombie survival game where you play as a human trying to survive a zombie horde as long as possible. Be warned, these zombies are smart! They use a finite-state machine to determine their behavior. While playing, look at the ways they transition between wandering, chasing you, being on alert, or fighting you!

### How to Play
To play, run the View.java file, and then choose the number of zombies you'd like to run from. Movement uses either WASD or the arrow keys. If zombies touch you, you'll lose health as they attack you. Once your health reaches zero, you lose!

### Known Problems
The player's sprite doesn't appear until your first input, so make sure to start moving immediately!

Also, zombie placement is completely randomized, so be warned that zombies may start the game directly on top of your character! To avoid this, play with fewer zombies at first.

### Dev Notes

This originated as a group project I did for my COMP128: Data Structures class. The details on the original class project, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHyrvtjqpmBZaMnEqKZIDqbY-pYjA7C2B-raVB2e3vU/edit?usp=sharing).
